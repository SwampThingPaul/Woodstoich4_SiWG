## The role of silicon in elemental ratios along a land-sea continuum

Silicon (Si) plays an important role in the growth of diatoms, aquatic plants, and macrophytes, such that its availability can significantly alter C:N:P ratios across several scales. Despite its importance, studies have largely overlooked the role of Si on elemental ratios, particularly in response to human-driven processes such as land-use change and agricultural run-off. Our objective is to  evaluate the relative importance of Si relative to C, N, and P stoichiometry along a land-sea continuum by 1) reviewing the current state of knowledge with regard to the importance of Si across systems, 2) exploring its influence on C:N:P stoichiometry under different conditions, and 3) highlighting areas where further research is needed.
